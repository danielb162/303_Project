# 303_Project
Term project for McGill course COMP 303, 'Software Design'.

This repository contains my answer for Question 2 of the included assignment PDF. Essentially, the question asks us to implement a simulator where, on a 2D plane, we populate our grid with 'Autonomous', 'Moveable' and 'Immovable' objects. We then simulate (random) movement for the Autonomous objects (which can 'bump'/push Moveable objects around) and implment a simple GUI using Swing.
